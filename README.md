By The Book – A Personal Book Library Website.
Created by Dotan Hillel

I'm Dotan Hillel, and By The Book is my first full website project. This website organizes all the books I have read, and many more. It includes summaries, reviews, jokes,
quizzes, and recommendations. I’m building this project because I love books, and I love helping people discover new ones.
There’s something special about giving someone a book and watching them fall into it with no way to stop reading.

Project Goals:
First, I noticed that many people my age don’t read much anymore, even though books can be amazing, exciting, funny, emotional, and unforgettable.
So I wanted to create a place where books can find their readers.
Second, I wanted to improve my HTML and English skills during a funny project.

About Me:
I'm a high school student who loves coding and reading. For me, this project is not about learning HTML, It is about helping people to find
their books, and help books find their people. And finally, help books to continue their journey throught time by connecting them to new readers.
