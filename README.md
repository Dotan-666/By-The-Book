I'm Dotan Hillel, and By The Book is my first website. this website organizes all of the books I have read, and more. It includes summaries, reviews, jokes,
quizzes, and recommendations. I have a lots of fun working on this project because I love books so much, and more than that, 
I like to bring books to other people, who will maybe love them too - It is so lovely to bring somepne a book, and see him read itwithout a way to stop.

This project's goal, is first to bring books to people, and people to books. That because I saw how many books people read in my generation, it felt sad,
because these books are so wonderful, interesting, exciting... and no one reads them. So I wanted to help books find their people. 
Second, I wanted to improve my HTML and English skills during a fun project.
